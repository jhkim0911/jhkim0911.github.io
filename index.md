## <u>About Me</u>

Hello, my name is Junho Kim, a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. I am researching in Image and Video Systems Lab., under the supervision of Professor Yong Man Ro. I have experiences with mainly machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision. Now I am more focusing on large vision-language models, model robustness & safety, explainable ai, and causal inference.


## <u>Research Interests</u>

- **CV, NLP:** large vision-language models, large language models, multi-modal learning, video understanding
- **Machine Learning:** causal inference, model robustness & safety, explainable ai, unsupervised learning


## <u>Education</u>

- **KAIST**, Daejeon, South Korea (2019 - present)<br>- Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering<br>- Advisor: Prof. Yong Man Ro
- **Dongguk University**, Seoul, South Korea (2012 - 2019)<br>- B.S. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering
