## <u>About Me</u>

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign (UIUC), working with Prof. James M. Rehg on large-scale multimodal intelligence. I earned my Ph.D. from KAIST under Prof. Yong Man Ro.

My long-term research vision is to develop a principled scientific understanding of how multimodal models perceive, reason, and fail. I am especially interested in uncovering the underlying mechanisms that govern large vision-language models, and in building methods that make them more robust, interpretable, and reliable in open-world environments. I believe such foundations are essential for enabling multimodal systems that can generalize across tasks, domains, and modalities.
