## About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign (UIUC), working with Prof. James M. Rehg on large-scale multimodal intelligence. I completed my Ph.D. at KAIST, where I was advised by Prof. Yong Man Ro.

My long-term research interest lies in understanding how multimodal models perceive and reason about the world—and why they sometimes fail. I study the factors that drive the behavior of large vision-language models and design methods that make them more reliable, robust, and interpretable. My goal is to build principled foundations that support multimodal systems capable of adapting across different tasks, domains, and real-world conditions.
