## <u>About Me</u>

Hello, my name is Junho Kim. I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in the Rehg Lab, led by Prof. James M. Rehg. I received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from KAIST, where I worked in the Image and Video Systems Lab under the supervision of Prof. Yong Man Ro. My research interests include large vision-language models, robustness & safety, explainable AI, and causal inference.
