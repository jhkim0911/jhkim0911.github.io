## <u>About Me</u>

Hello, my name is Junho Kim, a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. I am researching in Image and Video Systems Lab., under the supervision of Professor Yong Man Ro. I have experiences with mainly machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision. Now I am more focusing on unified model, explainable ai, adversarial robustness, and causal inference.


## <u>Research Interests</u>

- **Computer Vision:** image recognition, multi-modal unification, image segmentation
- **Machine Learning:** causal inference, explainable ai, adversarial robustness, unsupervised learning
